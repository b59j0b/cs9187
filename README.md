Part 1 - Individual: Personal Reflection on Your Group Working 
Experience 
Introduction 
In any successful engineering business, there   will usually be a ‘lessons learned’ review   as part of   the close-out of any significant project.   The review helps   the organisation to:
•         ensure   that successful aspects of   the project are documented so   they can be   repeated in   the   future.
•          ensure that significant mistakes or errors   will not be repeated.
In   this assessment   task   you are going   to complete a similar   type of activity, but at a personal level.   You   will reflect on   your personal experience of   the group project   within   this unit. But   what does a good personal reflection look like?A good reflection should   be: 
1. Personal – By yourself and   for   yourself.
2. Relevant – Focused and connected   with   the subject   topic(s).
3. Self-critical – Shows   your ability   to consider   yourself   from   the   viewpoint of   others (including both positive   and negative   factors).
4. Analytical – Move beyond simple descriptions   to logical reasoning   for actions,   feeling, decisions etc.
5. Constructive – Discusses   your   future approach   and any actionable steps   that   can be   taken   for   future improvements.
Task 
You are   to produce a   video or narrated presentation   that contains answers   to   the following   three questions: Use   the example questions given below   to help   you   frame. your reflection and   to get started.   You do not have   to address   these exact   questions but   do use   the questions   to prompt   you in   what   you discuss.
Question 1: What role and tasks did you take or were assigned to you by the rest of your group? 
You can use   these prompts   to help compose   your answer:
•         Were   these roles a good match   for   your skills, experience and   interests or   were   they unsuitable, and if so,   why?
• Was   there another role that   you   would have preferred   to have   taken and   why?
•         What roles do   you see   yourself gravitating   towards   future projects of   this nature   and   why?
•         Are   there any gaps   you have identified between   the roles   you like and   the roles   you are ready   for and how might   you address those gaps?
Question 2: How do you think the interactions within the team developed? 
You can use   these prompts   to help compose   your answer:
•          Did good teamworking develop quickly or did issues present   themselves?
•          How did   you   try   to address any   teamworking issues, and   were   your interventions   successful?
• On a   future project,   what methods might   you   implement   to improve   teamwork?
• Are   there aspects of   the   way   you   work   that can (or did) cause issues for others?
•         What did other members of   the   team do   that may have caused   trouble   for   you   and how did   you manage   that?
•          How can   you overcome the gaps between how   you like   to   work and   what others   seem   to   want?
Question 3: What do you think helped the project proceed effectively, what did not, and why? 
You can use   these prompts   to help compose   your answer:
•          Did   you   find   the   taught   tools beneficial, or did   you experience any difficulties   deploying   the methods?
•          Did the   team make any mistakes and how   will   you avoid   these in   the   future?
Constraints 
The   volume of content is limited by a   time limit.   You must produce content   that should   take an academic professional between 4-8 minutes   to   watch or   listen.
Things You Should Do 
1.      Start keeping a personal   journal of   your experiences   working   with   your group and   review it regularly.   This   will also help   you learn more about   yourself and develop your   teamwork skills.
2.      Stick   to   the   time limits; an article   that is less   than 4 minutes long   will not allow   enough   time to answer   the most basic questions in enough detail to pass.   An代 写Electrical and Electronics Engineering Practice EEME20002R
代做程序编程语言y   content presented   that   falls outside   the 4-8 minute limit   will not be marked. 
3.      Try   to balance   your composition equally across   the   three areas of reflection.
4.      Discuss   your interactions   with   team members, but keep   your comments anonymous, respectful and as objective as possible.   Any comments made in   relation   to   your performance or other   team members'performances   will not positively or negatively impact any other assessments in   the unit (i.e. this reflection is   treated as an independent exercise).   Your reflection   will not be   discussed   with or seen by any other student.
5.      Make sure   your   work is   your own. It may be checked   for plagiarism.   Where   you want   to include other sources in   your   work   you must reference   these correctly in   your   writing
6.      Use a Bibliography to list   your references. Label   the citations in   your   text   with   numbers in square brackets e.g. [6] and   then list   them   with   the same number in   the bibliography.
7.      Use the prompts given in Part 1, 2 and 3 to help   you   frame   your reflection and to   get started.   You do not have   to address   these exact questions but do use   the questions   to prompt   you in   what   you discuss.
8.      Use this file-naming convention: EEME20002_2024_Part1[Student Number] plus the appropriate filename extension for   your submission. Here is an example for   you: EEME20002_2024_Part1_1234567.pdf
IMPORTANT: 
1.      Do not leave   this   task until   the   very last minute; if   you do,   then   you   will only remember   the most recent events and   then   you may not present a balanced   overview.
2.      Do not   treat   this as ‘selling exercise’   where   you try   to portray   your professional   practice skills in a purely positive light. Rather, it is an honest self-appraisal of your experience  performance (both good and bad).
3.      You should not include any experience of   the Industrial Mentoring scheme.   This   reflection is   just about   your group project   within   this unit.
4.      Do not identify   any specific individuals   from   your group in   your reflection.   These   reflections are related   to   the process rather   than   the people involved.
5.   Do not complete this   task   working   with other people at   the same time.   This is a private and confidential activity, and   your composition should not be influenced   by   the   views of other people   who may know   your co-workers socially.
Part 2 -Group: Digital Design Submission (single Zipped file) 
Requirements 
The entire   team is required   to submit a single entry through one group member. Ensure   that all necessary   files are included in   your submission.   The zip   file must contain:

Assignment Summary 
You are required to design, build and test a peak detector on an FPGA board   which is under   the control of a computer.   The system operates   via a   terminal emulator, such as   PuTTY, facilitating command input from an   external PC.   The assignment specifies using   a   Xilinx   Artix 7 FPGA,   which communicates   with   the external PC using   the RS232 protocol. Key   functionalities include processing a specified number of data bytes, detecting peak   values, and returning related byte sequences.   Commands allow users   to start data processing, list peak results, and reset   the system.   The coursework emphasizes understanding and effectively utilizing   the specifications   for implementing   the system. Key specifications are listed as   follows: 
• Set of user commands accepted   from PC keyboard, output printed on PC screen
•         Start command   to process NNN bytes of data. Print each byte processed in   the   terminal   window in hexadecimal   format, separated by spaces.

•          Capture of seven points around the highest peak; 3 on each side
•          Print   the peak byte itself,   followed by a space and   the peak index in decimal   format.
•          Use RS232 serial protocol   to communicate between PC and FPGA
